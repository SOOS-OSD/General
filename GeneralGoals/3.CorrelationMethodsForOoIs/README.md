The goal here is to establish a method to determine spatial and temporal correlation 
scales for classes of QoIs listed in deliverable 2. A method for estimating the
correlation scales in time and space of all QoIs should be presented and assessed. 
This gives a first guess at observational density requirements. When feasible scales
should be calculated and published.
