This file contains a Compiled list of quantities of interest (QoIs) or classes 
of QoIs that methods of observing system evaluation must be able to handle. 
The observing system design depends on the QoI. The QoI could be an essential ocean
variable (EOV; e.g. T, S, Fe, O2, pHâ€¦.), or it could be driven by a scientific question
(e.g. upper ocean property content, water mass formation rate, upwelling rate, 
downwelling rate, mixed layer depth, mixing layer depth, thermocline depth, ice export,
NCP, NPP, O2 sat, aragonite saturation). We may want to declare all EOVs QoIs,
and then ask other panels (e.g. SORP) for a list of other science-based QoIs.
This deliverable may also be considered a task of SOOS objective 1 in the SOOS
implementation plan.
