Provide methods for investigators (e.g. regional working groups) to design an
observing system to constrain their chosen QoIs. This uses information from 3 
and 4 to inform constraining QoIs. It must account for correlation vs covariance 
in terms of the chosen QoI by addressing the question: if a location is weakly
varying is it as important to constrain as a region that is strongly varying?
The primary tool to be employed here is some form of a mapping algorithm in which
reconstruction errors can be quantified for an ensemble of observing system design 
experiments (OSSEs).
