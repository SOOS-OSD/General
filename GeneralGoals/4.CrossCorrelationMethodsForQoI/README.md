Establish a method to determine cross-correlation scales for classes of QoIs listed 
in deliverable 2. True system design needs to account for cross-correlation between
the QoI and all observables. This is a more complex problem of greater dimension. 
We can break this into two steps:

a) Determine methodology to estimate cross-covariance magnitude between a QoI and 
an observable. Observables that strongly covary with classes of QoIs should be noted.

b) Determine the cross-correlation scales for variables that strongly covary.
This follows on 3 and 4A, in that it informs how to constrain a QoI. However,
we may want to publish a statement on how the current observing system
(Argo, SST, SSH, sea ice area) informs other quantities of interest (e.g. pH).
We may also want to recommend enhancements to the current observing system for 
observables that strongly covary with QoIs, but are currently poorly constrained.
