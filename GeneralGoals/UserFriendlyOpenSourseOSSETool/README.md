Development of a user-friendly open-source OSSE tool. Enable straightforward OSSE 
investigations by developing tools that can be configured at runtime allowing 
non-experts to readily explore the methods, and removing the burden to write,
configure, and compile code. Provide either a downloadable executable or a web
interface where a user provides a netcdf vector of observations of any component
of the system and is returned informational maps and statistics estimating how
well that observational vector constrains their QoI. This must account for 
cross-correlation. Providing an ensemble of observational vectors quantifies
the “goodness” of their observational strategy.
